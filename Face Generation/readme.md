## About the project

This project aims to generate faces based on the faces of celebrities. 
The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks.
At the end of the project, the results of the trained Generator are presented to see how it performs. The generated samples are fairly realistic faces with noticable distortions.
